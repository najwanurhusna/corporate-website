					<h2><u>Establishment History</u></h2>
                        <p>The idea of ​​establishing a shelter for orphans in Kuang, began in the middle of 1989. History begins when a father dies by leaving 9 small children in his dependence. Following the incident, the orphans had been adopted by Tuan Haji Suhaimi Bin Dzajuli for about eleven months.</p>

					<p>Incidentally at that time, Mr. Haji Suhaimi Bin Dzajuli was Imam of the Al-Islahiyah mosque of 17 ¾ Kuang stone. It is also known by the members of the Al-Islahiyah Mosque and each one feels that a better effort should be made for the welfare of the children in the future. So one word was agreed to set up an orphanage in Kuang.</p>

					<p>The wish continues to be a reality when a servant of God has given a 0.5 acre plot on the lotus lane, Kuang for the purpose of building the hostel and the landowner has been handed over to the Waqf Division, Selangor Islamic Religious Council (MAIS) and Masjid Al - Islahiah Kuang has set up a temporary committee to manage orphans in the land.</p>

					<p>The development of this center has attracted the attention of many, where by in 1991 a total of 74 orphans were placed in the center. Most of them are residents in the vicinity and Selangor State. The Asrama Damai Kuang was commenced on Sunday, October 18, 1992 at 22 Rabiulakhir 1413H by Y.B Dato' Abu Bakar bin Abdul Hamid, DSSA, SMS, KDP, PJK. He was then a council member of the Selangor state government council.</p>


					<h2><u>Our Facilities & Accommodation</u></h2>
					<p>From time to time the residents of this hostel are increasing and the increase in the size of the hostel land dormitory to 4 acres in the name of waqaf for Asrama Damai Kuang. Infrastructure on Peace Dam land is as follows;</p>

						<li>3 Level Administrative Blocks, Library, Office, Store, Computer Room and Hall</li>

					<h2><u>Rumah Anak-Anak Yatim Damai Kuang: Present Day</u></h2>
					<p>As for today, Asrama Damai has placed 80 orphans and 7 single mothers residing in this hostel. Meanwhile, for the management staff of 15 staff and assisted by single mothers to cooperate in all are here. Operating expenditure requires a high and growing cost which is estimated at RM 30-35 thousand a month is required to cover the monthly expenses of the hostel.</p>

					<p>This funding is through the financing of NGOs, private companies and individuals. We are on the side of the management trying hard to give a better life to orphans here just like your children and grandmothers at home to guarantee their brighter and perfect future. Thank you.</p>

					<p>In 2014, we placed 40 Tahfiz Al-Quran students or known as Tahfiz Quran As-Solahiyyah Peace Center with 3 teaching staff. They operate on their own but under the supervision of the Peace Dormitory management. For more information please contact the Peace Dormitory management office.</p>

					<p>The management is very concerned about the education of its inhabitants, we have organized academic and religious programs to complement the quest for the world and the hereafter. In addition, collaborative programs between residents of Damai, single mothers and the Tahfiz Center are here to give us the advantage of filling existing space with useful programs.</p>

					<p>Lack of affection and also having a family problem that shuddering the minds of these children should be dealt with smoothly and carefully so that they are not mistaken, so we are looking forward to the presence of our hosts to equip us as much as we can. Keeping an orphan is a shared responsibility.</p>

					<p>Therefore, we are here to ask you to pray and support us so that we can meet our challenges in managing and carrying out the trust we are responsible for. Hopefully we are equally blessed from taking care of these orphans</p>
